# JavaMagics 
 <strong> Java Magician in making </strong>
 
Java Magics is a collection of Java programs that I have studied in High School . These programs are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Java programming and build a strong foundation for your future programming endeavors for anybody . 

## Getting Started

Before you begin, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer, **recommended Java 17 or later** You can download the JDK from the Oracle website. Once you have installed the JDK, you can start programming in Java.
Also you need a IDE to make your life easy and **IntelliJ IDEA Community** or any of your choice .Its your wish as per your comfort. 


## Rules for Uploading 
- You have to write an extended description how program works rather and a **well documented code** aka use of comments so that it becomes easy for people to know whats happening behind the scenes.
- No spamming in PRs and keep it clean make a new pull request everytime .
